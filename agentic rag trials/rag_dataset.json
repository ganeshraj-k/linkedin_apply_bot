In this project, Ganesh conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using matplotlib to gain insights for targeted marketing strategies. \n\nThe methodology involved building a multivariate logistic regression model using SAS, which is a statistical software used for data analysis. By analyzing customer data and behavior, Ganesh was able to identify customers who were at risk of churning, or leaving the bank. This model helped in predicting which customers were likely to churn, allowing the bank to take proactive measures to retain them.\n\nThe outcomes of this project were significant, with a 30% reduction in churn rate achieved. By identifying at-risk customers early on, the bank was able to implement targeted marketing strategies to retain these customers, ultimately leading to improved customer retention and satisfaction. Ganesh's use of SAS and EDA played a crucial role in the success of this project at Deloitte Consulting.",
